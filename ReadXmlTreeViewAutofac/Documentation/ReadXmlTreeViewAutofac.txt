Autofac project.

Create application which will read XML and from it will fill treeview using autofac

I will need to create a class which will load XML decoupled - that means it should be able to load whatever (for example list of categories from Joomla! - MySQL) and to show it in the treeView.

What I know for sure is that my interface should return something like List<string>, as parameter can take file path (if it is XML), or password, username and server if it is MySQL.

So, first I created "root" interface:

<pre class="brush:csharp">
public interface IRead
{
	List&lt;string&gt; Read();
}
</pre>

Then interface for reading XML like:

<pre class="brush:csharp">
public interface IReadXml
{
	void ReadXml(string XmlFile);
}
</pre>
